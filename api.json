      "summary": "The concept of 'nightmare' as a supernatural entity rather than merely a bad dream. Historically, a nightmare was a visit from the Mare demon—a malevolent spirit that rode sleepers at night, causing terrifying dreams and paralysis.",
      "full": "The word 'nightmare' represents a fascinating linguistic evolution from supernatural entity to psychological experience. Originally, a nightmare was not a metaphor for a bad dream—it was the literal visit from a demon called a Mare (Old English mære). The Mare was believed to ride sleeping victims like a horse (hence 'mare' in the riding sense, though etymologically unrelated to the word for female horse), sitting on their chests and causing terrifying dreams, paralysis, and suffocating sensations. Every culture developed similar entities to explain sleep paralysis: the Germanic Alp, Slavic Mara, Newfoundland Old Hag, African American Boo Hag, and countless others. The modern usage of 'nightmare' to simply mean 'bad dream' represents a semantic shift where the original supernatural meaning has been largely lost to common knowledge, even as the word remains in daily use. Historical nightmares were almost certainly descriptions of sleep paralysis episodes, a well-documented medical phenomenon now understood as a parasomnia occurring during sleep-wake transitions."
